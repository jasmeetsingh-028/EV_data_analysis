# Electric Vehicle (EV) Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes two datasets related to Electric Vehicles (EVs) and traditional automobiles. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, segmentation, and the creation of Power BI dashboards.

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks:** Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and experiments.
  - `seg01.ipynb`: Notebook for analyzing Dataset 1 (EV Data)
  - `seg02.ipynb`: Notebook for analyzing Dataset 2 (CA Details V3)

- **Datasets:** Contains the raw datasets used for analysis.
  - `ev_data1.csv`: Dataset 1 (EV Data)
  - `ca_details_v3.csv`: Dataset 2 (CA Details V3)

- **Processed Datasets:** Contains the processed datasets after analysis and segmentation.
  - `processed_dataset1.csv`: Processed Dataset 1
  - `processed_dataset2.csv`: Processed Dataset 2

- **Dashboard:** Contains Power BI dashboard files for the two processed datasets.
  - `dashboard_dataset1.pbix`: Power BI dashboard for Dataset 1
  - `dashboard_dataset2.pbix`: Power BI dashboard for Dataset 2

- `fetch.py`: Python script for web scraping EV data from https://ev-database.org/

## Getting Started

1. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks `seg01.ipynb` and `seg02.ipynb` to perform data analysis and segmentation on the respective datasets.

2. Explore the processed datasets and Power BI dashboards in the respective folders for more insights.

## Web Scraping EV Data

To retrieve updated EV data, you can use the provided `fetch.py` script for web scraping from [https://ev-database.org/](https://ev-database.org/).
